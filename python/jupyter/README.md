# Jupyter Notebooks for the PagerDuty REST API
As an experiment, I created a Jupyter notebook to guide users through some of the basic elements of working with the PagerDuty REST API.

To run this notebook, you can use an online environment like [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/), [Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.com/app/), 
or likely any service that supports Jupyter and allows you to install packages. 

You can also run the notebook locally with an environment like Anaconda.

## Requirements
To run the code examples in the notebook, you will need an active PagerDuty account and API Access Key - either a global key or a user key.

In the PagerDuty account, you will need to have configured at least one Service, one Team, one Escalation Policy, and one Schedule for all of the cells to return 
good responses.
