It's through the `service` assignment that an `incident` will trigger an `escalation_policy`. An `incident` itself can't trigger the policy, it must be assigned to a `service`.\n",

        "* `first_trigger_log_entry` is an interesting item. Each `incident` has a log of actions, like updates, that can be accessed in the web UI in the \"Timeline\" tab. You can see the first log entry here. There is another endpoint for collection the other log entries.\n",
